**Lumera node (lumerad)** is a Cosmos-SDK chain (v0.50.x) powering two core services via modules: **Actions** (a registry/coordination layer for service requests) and **SuperNode** (operators that fulfill those requests for Cascade storage and, later, Sense)  .
Actions are type-extensible using a **registry pattern** (validators + metadata handlers per type); current types: **Cascade** (decentralized storage using RaptorQ + Kademlia) and planned Sense; each type has its own metadata and validation paths, keeping core logic lean  .
The **SuperNode** module enforces operator eligibility and now supports **dual-source stake validation** (LEP3: self-delegation + SN account delegation) to meet minimum stake while preserving security signals .
On-chain **params** (fees, limits, timing) are source-of-truth and tuned via governance; the genesis shows canonical values and denom metadata (LUME/ulume) for fee and gas calculations .
Cascade emphasizes **lightweight on-chain metadata** (LEP1 “layout index” indirection) to keep tickets small while keeping verifiability of stored data and replicas in the P2P mesh .

**When reviewing PRs, Copilot should prioritize:**

* Proto changes are the **single source of truth**; generated code matches and handlers/validators are updated for any new Action types .
* State-machine integrity for Actions (Pending/Processing/Done/Approved/Failed/Expired) and correct event emission on transitions .
* SuperNode eligibility & LEP3 logic enforced in registration/hooks; clear error reporting retained .
* Param usage (fees, limits, timeouts) consistent with **genesis**/Params; no hard-coded constants for amounts/denoms .
* Cascade metadata paths keep indices minimal per **LEP1** and preserve verification steps (IDs, signatures) .
