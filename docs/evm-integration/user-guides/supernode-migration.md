# Supernode Operator EVM Migration Guide

**Last updated**: 2026-06-16
**Applies to**: operators running a Lumera supernode against an EVM-enabled chain (post-EVM upgrade)
**Prerequisite reading**: [migration.md](migration.md) for the chain-level mechanics of legacy → EVM account migration

---

## Overview

When Lumera upgraded to an EVM-compatible chain, every supernode's legacy `secp256k1` key (coin-type 118) stopped matching the chain's new address derivation (`eth_secp256k1`, coin-type 60). The supernode daemon performs the migration automatically on startup once you add a new EVM key to its config.

**This is the common case for virtually every supernode operator.** The rest of this document is the main walkthrough for that case.

> If your supernode's on-chain operator account is a K-of-N multisig (rare, and only possible if you explicitly set one up), the daemon refuses to migrate and directs you to a manual `lumerad` CLI ceremony. See the [Multisig supernode accounts](#multisig-supernode-accounts) section at the end.

Migration is idempotent end-to-end: if anything fails mid-flight, restart the daemon and it resumes from whatever state the chain already has.

---

## Two ways to migrate (pick one)

Both paths land in the same final state (new EVM key registered as supernode, legacy key deleted, `config.yml` updated). The operator steps are identical — what differs is whether the daemon initiates the on-chain migration or just finalizes one you already submitted.

- **Path A — Supernode daemon migrates for you (recommended default).** You recover a new EVM key into the supernode keyring, add `evm_key_name` to `config.yml`, and restart. The daemon detects the legacy key, dual-signs with both keys, and broadcasts `MsgClaimLegacyAccount` itself. This is the flow the rest of this guide documents in steps 1–4.
- **Path B — Migrate via Keplr + Portal first, then let the supernode finalize.** You use the Portal's standard [end-user migration](migration.md#method-1-portal--keplr-recommended) (browser + Keplr) to submit the migration transaction yourself. Then on the supernode host, you recover the same EVM key into the supernode's keyring, update `config.yml`, and restart. On startup the daemon sees the on-chain migration record, matches it against your configured `evm_key_name`, skips the broadcast, and performs only local cleanup.

Path B is useful when you want to use Keplr's UX to see each step (the Portal shows balances, delegations, and a pre-migration checklist), when you need to migrate the account's balance urgently for non-supernode reasons, or when your node ops team and your wallet custody team are different people.

> **Terminal alternative for Path B.** If you prefer to stay in a shell rather than use Keplr, you can drive the account-level migration with the bundled shell helper scripts instead of the Portal — the end state (on-chain migration record + matching local key) is identical, and the supernode daemon's `alreadyMigrated` branch activates the same way on restart. See [migration-scripts.md](migration-scripts.md) for the full walkthrough, including multisig rejection, pre-flight estimates, and exit codes. In short:
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/migrate-account.sh legacy-key new-key \
>   --chain-id lumera-mainnet-1 --node tcp://rpc.lumera:26657
> ```
>
> Then continue with Step B3 (recover the new EVM key into the supernode keyring) onward.

**Why both paths work deterministically**: `supernode keys recover` derives keys at HD path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` using `eth_secp256k1`. Keplr uses the identical derivation for Lumera's EVM chain definition. Import the chosen destination mnemonic into both tools so they produce the same destination address. That mnemonic may be the legacy mnemonic or a different one.

If you chose Path B, the steps below are the same but in Step 3 the logs will show a *skipped* broadcast (see the **Path B log variant** callout in that section).

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

- Lumera chain is **EVM-enabled**. The supernode daemon verifies this at boot via `x/upgrade.ModuleVersions(evm)`. If the chain hasn't upgraded yet the daemon fatals with `connected Lumera chain does not have EVM support` — wait for the chain upgrade.
- You hold the **mnemonic (seed phrase)** for the legacy supernode key.
- You have access to the host running the supernode daemon and can edit `config.yml`.

---

## Step 1 — Generate or recover the EVM destination key

`supernode keys recover` always produces `eth_secp256k1` keys (coin-type 60). Run it with a **new key name** distinct from your legacy one:

```bash
supernode keys recover <evm-key-name> --mnemonic "twelve or twenty four mnemonic words ..."
```

Example:

```bash
`supernode keys recover supernode-evm --mnemonic "inspire words ... about"
```

The output prints the new EVM address derived at coin type 60 from the chosen destination mnemonic. Verify:

```bash
supernode keys list
```

You should see both your legacy key and the newly recovered EVM key. They may use the same mnemonic or different mnemonics; the new key uses coin type `60` and `eth_secp256k1`.

## Step 2 — Add `evm_key_name` to `config.yml`

Edit `config.yml` (inside your supernode base directory) and add the `evm_key_name` field under `supernode:` alongside the existing `key_name`:

```yaml
supernode:
  key_name: supernode-legacy       # existing legacy key (unchanged)
  evm_key_name: supernode-evm      # new — must match the name you chose in step 1
  identity: "lumera1...legacyaddr" # existing legacy address — daemon will rewrite on migration
  # ...
```

Keep `key_name` and `identity` as-is — the daemon rewrites both after migration succeeds.

## Step 3 — Restart the supernode

The daemon detects the legacy key + `evm_key_name` on boot and runs the migration automatically. Watch the logs:

```text
INFO  EVM module detected on chain
WARN  Legacy secp256k1 key detected — EVM account migration required
INFO  Migration estimate  {"would_succeed": true, "is_validator": false, "is_multisig": false, ...}
INFO  Migration tx passed CheckTx, waiting for block confirmation  {"tx_hash": "..."}
INFO  Migration tx confirmed in block
INFO  New address confirmed as registered supernode
INFO  EVM migration complete — legacy key removed, config updated
```

On success, the daemon has:

- Broadcast `MsgClaimLegacyAccount` (or `MsgMigrateValidator` if you're also a validator operator) with both signatures embedded.
- Waited for block inclusion.
- Deleted the old legacy key from the keyring.
- Rewritten `config.yml`: `key_name: supernode-evm`, `identity: lumera1...newEVMaddr`, `evm_key_name` removed.

From here on, the supernode runs on the EVM key with no further intervention.

### Path B log variant — already migrated via Keplr

If you chose Path B and already submitted the migration via the Portal + Keplr flow, the restart supernode logs look like this instead:

```text
INFO  EVM module detected on chain
WARN  Legacy secp256k1 key detected — EVM account migration required
INFO  Account already migrated on-chain, skipping broadcast
INFO  New address confirmed as registered supernode
INFO  EVM migration complete — legacy key removed, config updated
```

The daemon queries `MigrationRecord(legacyAddr)`, sees that the on-chain record's `new_address` matches the address derived from your local `evm_key_name`, sets the internal `alreadyMigrated=true` flag, and skips the broadcast branch. The rest of the cleanup (delete legacy key, rewrite `config.yml`) runs identically to Path A.

If the logs show `migration record exists on-chain but new address mismatch`, the EVM key you recovered into the supernode keyring isn't the one Keplr used during the Portal flow — either use the same mnemonic (the one that signed in the Portal), or investigate whether two different mnemonics got mixed up.

## Step 4 — Verify

Query the on-chain migration record:

```bash
lumerad query evmigration migration-record <legacy-address>
```

The response should show `new_address` matching your EVM key's address. Also confirm the supernode's on-chain registration points at the new address:

```bash
# get-supernode takes the VALOPER address (lumeravaloper1…), not the account
# address. Convert your new account address with:
#   lumerad keys show <new-key> -a --bech val
lumerad query supernode get-supernode <new-valoper-address>
```

Finally, confirm `config.yml` reflects the switch:

```bash
grep -E "key_name|identity|evm_key_name" ~/.supernode/config.yml
```

You should see `key_name: <evm-key-name>`, `identity: <new-evm-address>`, and no `evm_key_name` line.

## Path B — Migrating via Portal + Keplr first

Use this section if you chose Path B from the ["Two ways to migrate"](#two-ways-to-migrate-pick-one) choice above. Follow the steps in order — don't interleave with Path A steps.

### Before you start

- Import the chosen destination mnemonic in Keplr and on the supernode host so both control the destination recorded by the migration. It may be the legacy mnemonic or a different mnemonic.
- Decide *when* you'll run each step. A safe order is: stop the supernode → migrate in Keplr → recover the EVM key → edit config → restart. Leaving the supernode running between the Portal migration and the final restart is not harmful (the legacy account no longer exists on-chain, so the supernode's outgoing txs will fail fast), but it produces alarming-looking errors in the logs until you restart.

### Step B1 — Stop the supernode

```bash
systemctl stop supernode   # or whatever init system you use
```

Stopping avoids log noise and ensures no inflight txs from the legacy key race with the migration.

### Step B2 — Migrate the account via the Portal (Keplr)

Follow the standard end-user migration flow in [migration.md → Method 1: Portal + Keplr](migration.md#method-1-portal--keplr-recommended). The supernode account behaves like any other Keplr account in this flow — there's nothing supernode-specific to do in the browser.

Quick summary of what you'll do:

1. Open the Lumera Portal's **Claim** page.
2. Connect Keplr with the mnemonic that currently controls the legacy supernode account.
3. The portal auto-detects the legacy account, shows your balance/delegations/supernode status, and offers a "Ready to Migrate" wizard.
4. Click through Review → Sign & Confirm → Submit. Keplr will pop up twice to sign the legacy proof (ADR-036) and the new proof (Ethereum `personal_sign`).
5. The portal confirms the transaction and shows the migration record with `new_address`.

After the Portal shows success, verify the on-chain record on the host (or on the Portal's success screen):

```bash
lumerad query evmigration migration-record <legacy-address>
```

Note the `new_address` — you'll verify that it matches what the supernode derives locally in Step B5.

### Step B3 — Recover the new EVM key into the supernode keyring

Exactly the same operation as Path A's Step 1. **Use the same mnemonic you used in Keplr** — this is the critical piece that makes Path B work:

```bash
supernode keys recover <evm-key-name> --mnemonic "twelve or twenty four mnemonic words ..."
supernode keys list
```

Confirm the printed EVM address matches the `new_address` you saw in the Portal and in the migration record. If they don't match, stop — you're using a different mnemonic than Keplr did, and the supernode will refuse to finalize.

### Step B4 — Add `evm_key_name` to `config.yml`

Exactly the same operation as Path A's Step 2:

```yaml
supernode:
  key_name: supernode-legacy       # existing legacy key (unchanged)
  evm_key_name: supernode-evm      # must match the name you chose in Step B3
  identity: "lumera1...legacyaddr" # existing legacy address — daemon will rewrite on restart
  # ...
```

### Step B5 — Restart the supernode (local cleanup only)

```bash
systemctl start supernode
```

On startup the daemon:

1. Detects the legacy key in the keyring (`is_legacy_key=true`).
2. Queries `MigrationRecord(legacyAddr)` — finds the record you submitted via Keplr.
3. Compares the record's `new_address` to the address derived from your locally-imported `evm_key_name` — they match (same mnemonic, same HD path, same algorithm).
4. Sets `alreadyMigrated=true` and **skips the broadcast step entirely**.
5. Performs only local cleanup: rewrites `config.yml` (`key_name` → evm key name, `identity` → new address, removes `evm_key_name`), deletes the old legacy key from the keyring.

Expected logs — see the [Path B log variant](#path-b-log-variant--already-migrated-via-keplr) callout in Step 3 for the exact sequence. The key line is `INFO  Account already migrated on-chain, skipping broadcast`.

### Step B6 — Verify

Same as Path A's [Step 4 — Verify](#step-4--verify). Three queries — migration record, supernode registration at the new address, and `config.yml` state — all should reflect the new EVM address.

### Path B gotchas

- **Different mnemonic on supernode host**: if the mnemonic you recover with `supernode keys recover` is *not* the one you used in Keplr, the derived bech32 addresses differ, and the daemon logs `migration record exists on-chain but new address mismatch` and exits. Recover with the Keplr mnemonic and retry.
- **Picked the wrong Keplr account**: if Keplr held multiple accounts and you migrated the wrong one, the on-chain migration record points to the wrong legacy address. Check the Portal's success page for the legacy address it migrated from — it must match your supernode's current `identity`.
- **Supernode never stopped**: if the supernode kept running between Step B2 and Step B5, its outbound txs will have been erroring with "account not found" for the duration. This is cosmetic — the final restart clears the state. But stop-first is cleaner.
- **Multisig legacy account**: Path B does not apply to multisig supernode accounts — Keplr can't drive a K-of-N ceremony. See the [Multisig supernode accounts](#multisig-supernode-accounts) section.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `evm_key_name "<name>" is not an eth_secp256k1 key`

You created or recovered the EVM-named key with the wrong algorithm. Delete it and re-run `supernode keys recover` (which always produces `eth_secp256k1`).

### `simulation failed: rpc error: ... invalid length: tx parse error`

The supernode binary is older than the chain's `x/evmigration` proto schema. Upgrade to a supernode build that includes the `LegacyProof` refactor (single-sig sends `LegacyProof{Single: SingleKeyProof{…}}` instead of the retired flat `legacy_pub_key`/`legacy_signature` fields).

### `connected Lumera chain does not have EVM support`

The chain hasn't run the EVM upgrade yet. This supernode binary is post-EVM-only — run the older pre-EVM binary, or wait for the chain upgrade.

### `migration record exists on-chain but new address mismatch`

Someone completed migration with a different EVM key than the one now in your `evm_key_name` config. Either:

- Use the EVM key that actually signed the original migration (re-recover it with the mnemonic that was used), or
- Investigate whether the on-chain `new_address` is correct — it's the authoritative record.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to migrate on day 1 of the EVM upgrade?**
No — unless governance sets a deadline via the `migration_end_time` param. In practice you migrate when you upgrade the binary, since the new binary is EVM-only.

**Q: Will my supernode lose its ranking / history across the migration?**
No. The migration re-keys the on-chain record: your supernode registration, evidence history, and metrics carry over under the new address. `x/evmigration` transfers all referenced state atomically.

**Q: My supernode runs as both a validator operator and a supernode. Do I migrate twice?**
No — a single `MsgMigrateValidator` re-keys both the validator operator record and the supernode record bound to it. See [validator-migration.md](validator-migration.md) for the validator-specific walkthrough (including the maintenance window and the `max_validator_delegations` check); the supernode side happens as a side-effect of that tx.

**Q: Can I roll back if the migration fails mid-flight?**
No rollback is needed — the daemon is idempotent. If the broadcast fails, restart; if the broadcast succeeded but local cleanup failed, restart. Each restart resumes from the current chain state.

## Multisig supernode accounts

This section only applies if your on-chain supernode operator account is a flat K-of-N multisig (`LegacyAminoPubKey`). If your supernode was set up normally with a single-sig key, **you don't need this section** — follow steps 1–4 above.

The new operator account is **also** a K-of-N multisig, constructed from `eth_secp256k1` sub-keys (see the [mirror-source rule](../evmigration/main.md#multisig-account-migration) in `evmigration/main.md`). The ceremony described below produces that new multisig, builds a dual-side proof, and broadcasts it.

> **Consensus invariants (multisig).** The chain rejects a multisig supernode-operator migration tx at `ValidateBasic` if any of these is violated:
>
> - **Shape + K/N mirror.** K-of-N legacy → K-of-N new, same K and same N (`ErrMirrorSourceMismatch`).
> - **Matching `signer_indices`.** The same K signer positions approve both halves.
> - **Sub-key uniqueness.** No duplicate entries in either side's `sub_pub_keys` list.
> - **Zero-signer submit.** `submit-proof` takes no `--from`, no fee flags, no envelope signature.
>
> Full reference: [legacy-migration.md § Consensus invariants](../evmigration/legacy-migration.md#consensus-invariants).

### Why automatic migration is refused

The supernode daemon holds a single signing key and cannot run the K-of-N ceremony required for multisig migration. When it detects `is_multisig=true` from `MigrationEstimate`, it fatals with:

```text
legacy supernode account lumera1... is a 2-of-3 multisig; automatic migration is not supported.

The daemon holds a single key and cannot run the multi-party signing ceremony.
Please complete migration offline using the lumerad CLI, then restart supernode —
the existing on-chain record will trigger local cleanup automatically.

Four-step offline ceremony:

  # 1) Each co-signer generates a fresh eth_secp256k1 sub-key; coordinator
  #    derives the new multisig:
  lumerad keys add <op>-eth-<N> --key-type eth_secp256k1 --keyring-backend <backend>
  lumerad keys add <op>-msig-new --multisig <op>-eth-1,<op>-eth-2,<op>-eth-3 \
    --multisig-threshold K --nosort --keyring-backend <backend>

  # 2) Coordinator builds the proof template:
  lumerad tx evmigration generate-proof-payload \
    --legacy <multisig-legacy-address> \
    --new <new-multisig-address> \
    --new-sub-pub-keys <op>-eth-1,<op>-eth-2,<op>-eth-3 \
    --new-threshold K \
    --kind claim --chain-id <chain-id> --out proof.json

  # 3) Each of K co-signers signs both sides in one call:
  lumerad tx evmigration sign-proof proof.json \
    --from <my-legacy-sub-key> --new-key <my-eth-sub-key> \
    --keyring-backend <backend> --chain-id <chain-id> \
    --out <signer>-partial.json

  # 4) Combine and submit (no --from on submit-proof):
  lumerad tx evmigration combine-proof *-partial.json --out tx.json
  lumerad tx evmigration submit-proof tx.json --chain-id <chain-id>
```

### Multisig flow overview

You complete the 4-step offline ceremony with `lumerad`, then restart the supernode — the daemon detects the on-chain migration record and finishes local cleanup through its idempotent path.

#### Step 1 — Generate N fresh `eth_secp256k1` sub-keys and derive the new multisig

Each co-signer generates their own destination-side eth sub-key on their own host (or wherever they hold the legacy sub-key). The coordinator collects the resulting pubkeys and derives the new multisig address:

```bash
# Each co-signer, on their own machine:
lumerad keys add <op-name>-eth-<N> --key-type eth_secp256k1 \
  --keyring-backend <backend>

# Coordinator, once all N eth sub-keys are available:
lumerad keys add <op-name>-msig-new \
  --multisig <op-name>-eth-1,<op-name>-eth-2,<op-name>-eth-3 \
  --multisig-threshold 2 \
  --nosort \
  --keyring-backend <backend>

lumerad keys show <op-name>-msig-new --address
# lumera1...   <-- the new multisig bech32; record this as new_address
```

> **`--nosort` is required, and member order must mirror the legacy side.** Without `--nosort`, `keys add` sorts sub-keys by address, so this composite address won't match the one `generate-proof-payload` derives from `--new-sub-pub-keys` (which preserves the listed order), and the signer indices won't line up. List the members in the **same order as the legacy multisig's `public_keys`** (`lumerad query auth account <multisig-legacy-address>`) so each co-signer holds the same signer index on both sides — the consensus mirror-source rule requires `legacy_proof.signer_indices == new_proof.signer_indices`.

This replaces the old single-EOA "recover the new EVM key" step: the destination is a multisig derived from fresh eth sub-keys, not an EOA recovered from a mnemonic.

Set `evm_key_name` in the supernode's `config.yml` to the name of the new multisig key (`<op-name>-msig-new` in the example above) — the daemon will detect this during the post-migration restart and run cleanup.

#### Step 2 — Ensure the multisig's pubkey is on-chain

If the multisig has received funds but never signed a transaction, its `LegacyAminoPubKey` is nil on-chain and `generate-proof-payload` will fail. Submit any transaction from the multisig first (a 1-`ulume` self-send is sufficient), then confirm:

```bash
lumerad query auth account <multisig-legacy-address>
```

The response must show a `multisig` pubkey structure listing all N legacy sub-keys.

#### Step 3 — Coordinator generates the proof payload template

```bash
lumerad tx evmigration generate-proof-payload \
  --legacy <multisig-legacy-address> \
  --new <new-multisig-address-from-step-1> \
  --new-sub-pub-keys <op-name>-eth-1,<op-name>-eth-2,<op-name>-eth-3 \
  --new-threshold 2 \
  --kind claim \
  --chain-id <chain-id> \
  --keyring-backend <backend> \
  --out proof.json
```

- `--new-sub-pub-keys` accepts either keyring key names or base64 compressed 33-byte `eth_secp256k1` pubkeys. Mix freely.
- `--new-threshold` is **required** whenever `--new-sub-pub-keys` is set.
- `--kind claim` targets `MsgClaimLegacyAccount`; use `--kind validator` if the multisig is also a validator operator.
- `--chain-id` is **required** — it is embedded in the signed payload, so an empty or wrong value makes every sub-signature fail verification on-chain.
- `generate-proof-payload` does not broadcast anything, but it **does** need keyring access (to resolve `--new-sub-pub-keys` / `--legacy-key` entries that are local key names). Pass `--keyring-backend` (and `--keyring-dir` / `--home` when applicable).

Distribute `proof.json` to all co-signers.

#### Step 4 — Each co-signer signs both sides in one invocation

Every participating co-signer must hold **both** their legacy Cosmos sub-key (`--from`) **and** their destination-side eth sub-key (`--new-key`) in the same keyring. `sign-proof` signs both sides and writes a single partial file:

```bash
lumerad tx evmigration sign-proof proof.json \
  --from <my-legacy-sub-key-name> \
  --new-key <my-eth-sub-key-name> \
  --keyring-backend <backend> \
  --chain-id <chain-id> \
  --out <signer>-partial.json
```

`sign-proof` is idempotent on both sides — re-running it replaces this signer's prior entries in both `partial_legacy_signatures` and `partial_new_signatures`, never duplicates. Each co-signer sends their partial file back to the coordinator.

#### Step 5 — Coordinator combines partials

```bash
lumerad tx evmigration combine-proof \
  alice-partial.json bob-partial.json carol-partial.json \
  --out tx.json
```

`combine-proof` rejects the set if any two partials disagree on `chain_id`, `evm_chain_id`, `legacy_address`, `new_address`, `payload_hex`, proof kind, or either side's `sub_pub_keys` list. It verifies every merged partial on both legacy and new sides, drops invalid entries with a stderr warning, then **intersects** the valid signer-index sets across the two sides and selects the first K indices present on BOTH. This is what guarantees `legacy_proof.signer_indices == new_proof.signer_indices`, the consensus-level mirror-source rule. A one-sided partial (e.g. a co-signer who signed only the legacy half because they lost their eth sub-key) does not contribute toward quorum unless another co-signer supplied the new-side signature at the same index. If the intersection has fewer than K entries, combine-proof errors with `need <K> valid partial signatures signed on BOTH sides at matching indices, have <N>` and writes nothing.

#### Step 6 — Coordinator submits the pre-assembled tx

```bash
lumerad tx evmigration submit-proof tx.json \
  --chain-id <chain-id>
```

`submit-proof` broadcasts the pre-assembled tx **without signing at the Cosmos layer**. Migration messages declare zero signers (authorization is fully embedded in `legacy_proof` and `new_proof`), fees are waived by the evmigration ante handler, and replay is prevented by the keeper's `MigrationRecords.Has(legacyAddr)` check. There is no `--from` broadcaster key, no fee-payer, and no envelope signature — `submit-proof` loads `tx.json`, runs `ValidateBasic`, simulates gas via the migration-specific estimator, builds an unsigned tx, and broadcasts.

Verify the migration record:

```bash
lumerad query evmigration migration-record <multisig-legacy-address>
```

#### Step 7 — Restart the supernode (local cleanup only)

The daemon detects the on-chain migration record, confirms its `new_address` matches the multisig bech32 derived from the `evm_key_name` you configured in Step 1, skips the broadcast step (idempotent), rewrites `config.yml` (`key_name` → new multisig key name, `identity` → new multisig bech32, clears `evm_key_name`), and deletes the old legacy multisig composite from the keyring.

Expected logs on the cleanup restart:

```text
INFO  EVM module detected on chain
WARN  Legacy secp256k1 key detected — EVM account migration required
INFO  Account already migrated on-chain, skipping broadcast
INFO  New address confirmed as registered supernode
INFO  EVM migration complete — legacy key removed, config updated
```

### Why the new operator is not EVM-addressable

The new operator account is a Cosmos SDK multisig bech32 derived from `kmultisig.NewLegacyAminoPubKey` over N `eth_secp256k1` sub-keys. It is **not** an Ethereum 20-byte address. This is a non-goal, not a limitation:

- The new operator can perform **all** Cosmos-side operations required for supernode life-cycle: `MsgEditSupernode`, validator edits (if applicable), `x/staking` delegations, `x/distribution` withdrawals, `x/authz` grants, and IBC transfers. Every supernode-relevant workflow continues to work.
- The new operator **cannot** originate `MsgEthereumTx` — multisig bech32 addresses are not valid senders for EVM transactions, and there is no way to produce a single ECDSA signature that authenticates K-of-N.

Operators who want EVM DeFi access for their supernode rewards should configure a separate **single-EOA withdraw address** via:

```bash
lumerad tx distribution set-withdraw-addr <single-eth-eoa> \
  --from <new-multisig-key> \
  --multisig <new-multisig-key> \
  --chain-id <chain-id> \
  # ... plus the usual multisig sign/sign-batch/multi-sign/broadcast steps
```

Rewards then accrue to the single-EOA withdraw address, which **is** EVM-addressable and can originate `MsgEthereumTx` to interact with any EVM contract.

### Post-migration cleanup

The daemon's idempotent cleanup path detects the on-chain multisig `BaseAccount.PubKey` (set by `MigrateAuth`) and treats it as the canonical record of "the operator has migrated". No workflow change is required from the operator beyond the restart in Step 7 — the daemon does not need to "know" that the new operator is a multisig; it simply confirms that the on-chain `new_address` matches the address derived locally from `evm_key_name` and runs cleanup.

### Migration order relative to sub-signer personal migrations

Supernode operators whose operator key is a multisig often ask whether they need to coordinate their personal account migrations with the multisig's migration ceremony. They do not: sub-signer and multisig migrations are mutually independent. See the "Migration order — FAQ" in [evmigration/main.md](../evmigration/main.md#migration-order--faq) for the full explanation; the short version is that any order works, including interleaved, and a sub-signer's personal migration never affects the multisig's ability to migrate later.

### Multisig troubleshooting

**`sub-sig 0 (signer lumera1…) invalid: legacy signature verification failed`** — one of the partial signatures didn't verify under its declared sub-pub-key. Most common causes:

- `--chain-id` differed between `generate-proof-payload` and what the chain uses (the chain-id is embedded in the signed payload).
- A co-signer edited `proof.json` between `generate-proof-payload` and `sign-proof`.
- Wrong legacy sub-key used by a signer (`--from` pointed at a key that isn't one of the legacy multisig members), or wrong destination sub-key (`--new-key` pointed at a key not in `--new-sub-pub-keys`).

Regenerate `proof.json` with the correct `--chain-id`, have the affected signer re-run `sign-proof`, then re-combine.

**`sub-sig N (signer lumera1…) invalid: new signature verification failed`** — symmetric failure on the destination side. Typically the signer used the wrong `--new-key` (not the eth sub-key they claimed during `generate-proof-payload`) or their eth sub-key isn't actually one of the entries in `--new-sub-pub-keys`. Fix the `--new-key` value and re-run `sign-proof` for that signer.

**The multisig account was migrated but the supernode still starts the automatic flow** — check that the on-chain record's `new_address` exactly matches the multisig bech32 of the `evm_key_name` configured in the supernode keyring. If they differ, the daemon won't detect the already-migrated state and will try to broadcast fresh. Align `evm_key_name` with the multisig key that was actually used during the offline ceremony.

**What if I only have K−1 of the sub-keys available on the legacy side?** — you can't complete migration. The K-of-N threshold is enforced by the keeper (`need <K> valid partial signatures, have <N>`). Recover the missing legacy sub-key(s) from their mnemonics, or coordinate with the actual holders.

**What if only K−1 co-signers have provided eth sub-keys for the destination side?** — same situation, symmetric: you need K valid new-side partials. Have the missing co-signer(s) generate their eth sub-key (`lumerad keys add ... --key-type eth_secp256k1`), rebuild `proof.json` via `generate-proof-payload` with the full `--new-sub-pub-keys` list, and re-sign.

**`legacy key "..." is signer index N, but new key "..." is signer index M; multisig migration requires the same signer position to approve both halves`** — raised by `sign-proof` when a co-signer passes both `--from` and `--new-key` in one call but the two keys occupy *different* positions in their respective multisigs. Each co-signer must hold the **same signer index** on the legacy and new sides (the consensus mirror-source rule requires `legacy_proof.signer_indices == new_proof.signer_indices`). The usual root cause is a destination multisig built without `--nosort` (so `keys add` sorted the sub-keys) or with a member order that doesn't mirror the legacy `public_keys`. Recreate `<op-name>-msig-new` with `--nosort`, listing the eth sub-keys in the same member order as the legacy multisig (`lumerad query auth account <multisig-legacy-address>`), then regenerate `proof.json` and re-sign.

**The supernode's embedded error message says `assemble-proof` but the CLI has `combine-proof`. Which is correct?** — the CLI command is `combine-proof`. Any older embedded error message in the supernode binary is stale; use this guide's commands.
